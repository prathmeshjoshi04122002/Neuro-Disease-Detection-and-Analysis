In order to perform clinical analysis and medical intervention, as well as to visually portray the operation
of certain organs or tissues, medical imaging is the method and technology of producing images of the
inside of the body. Medical imaging aims to identify and cure illnesses by revealing interior structures
that are covered by the skin and bones. In order to detect anomalies, medical imaging also creates a
database of typical anatomy and physiology.
The use of computers to handle pictures is referred to as medical imaging processing. Numerous
methods and procedures, including picture acquisition, storage, display, and communication, are part of
this processing. The detection and management of disorders are pursued by this procedure. In order to
make it simple to identify abnormalities, this procedure generates a data bank of the organs' typical
structure and function. This procedure combines radiological and organic imaging using thermal and

isotope imaging, sonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and electromagnetic energy (gamma and X-
rays). Numerous additional technologies are employed to capture data regarding the position and

operation of the body. Compared to modulates that generate pictures, such approaches have a lot more
limits.
Using a computer to alter a digital image is known as an image processing technique. This method
offers several advantages, including data storage, connectivity, flexibility, and adaptation. The
development of various picture scaling methods has made it possible to maintain photos effectively.
This method requires several sets of rules to be applied simultaneously in the pictures. Multiple
dimensions can be handled for both 2D and 3D pictures.

1.1 BRAIN ANATOMY
One of the most prevalent and, consequently, deadly brain disorders that has destroyed many
lives worldwide is the brain tumour. Cancer is a disease of the brain in which cancer cells grow
within the tissues of the brain. A recent study on cancer claims that over a lakh people
worldwide receive a brain tumour diagnosis each year.
Figures for brain tumour patients indicate unsatisfactory outcomes despite consistent attempts
to address the difficulties associated with the tumours. In response to this, researchers are
focusing on computer vision to get a deeper comprehension of the first phases of tumour
development and how to combat them with cutting-edge therapeutic approaches.
Computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MR) are the two most
used methods to identify whether a tumour is present and where it is located in order to make
treatment options. Because of its portability and increased capacity to provide high-definition
pictures of diseased tissues, these two scans are still widely employed. Currently, a number of
other treatments are available for tumours, including radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and
surgery. The size, nature, and grade of the tumor shown in the MR picture are only a few of the
numerous parameters that influence the therapy choice. Whether or whether cancer has spread
to other parts of the body is also its responsibility.



Accurate identification of the specific type of brain disorder is crucial for treatment planning
in order to reduce misdiagnoses. The accuracy is frequently haphazard while using
computeraided diagnostic (CAD) tools. The primary goal of computer vision is to reduce the
amount of time it takes for doctors to interpret images and to generate a dependable result in
the form of an associate estimate. These developments improve the consistency and accuracy
of medical diagnosis; still, segmenting an MR picture of a tumour and its surrounding tissue is
a highly challenging task. Another challenge that makes computerised brain tumour
identification and segmentation challenging is the appearance of tumours in certain places
within the brain image without differentiating picture intensities.

1.2 MOTIVATION FOR THE WORK
Cells growing abnormally inside the brain or central spinal canal is known as a brain tumour.
Certain tumours may be malignant, thus prompt detection and treatment are necessary. People
may be afflicted with brain tumours without realising the risk since the specific source and set
of symptoms are unknown. Malignant (containing cancer cells) and benign (without containing
cancer cells) are the two types of primary brain tumours.
Cells that were developing and dividing improperly gave rise to brain tumours. According to
diagnostic medical imaging methods, it seems to be a solid mass. Primary brain tumours and
metastatic brain tumours are the two forms of brain tumours. A primary brain tumour is one
that originates in the brain and tends to remain there, whereas a metastatic brain tumour is one
that spreads across the brain after originating in another part of the body.
The location, size, and kind of a brain tumour determine its symptoms. It happens when the
tumour exerts pressure on the surrounding cells while compressing them. Furthermore, it also
happens when a tumour obstructs the fluid that circulates throughout the brain. Headache,
nausea, vomiting, and difficulty balance and walking are frequent symptoms. Diagnostic
imaging techniques like CT and MRI can identify brain tumours. Depending on the type of site
and the requirement for an inspection, both methods offer benefits in terms of detection. We
have opted to utilise MRI scans in this study due to their ease of examination and ability to
provide precise calcification and foreign mass placement.
The method most frequently used to image brain tumours and determine their proximity is
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Aside from several alternative techniques, the traditional
approach for classifying CT and MR images and identifying tumour cells is still mostly
supported for human evaluation. The primary reason MR images are employed is that they are
non-destructive and non-ionizing. High-definition images provided by MR imaging are widely
used to identify brain tumours. MRI scans can be T1-weighted, T2weighted, or flair-weighted.
Numerous methods exist for processing photos, including feature extraction, pre-processing,
image segmentation, image enhancements, and classifiers.



1.3 PROBLEM STATEMENT
Our research focuses on the automatic identification and categorization of brain tumours. MRI
or CT scans are often used to analyse the anatomy of the brain. Tumour detection in brain
magnetic resonance imaging is the paper's goal. The primary purpose of brain tumour detection
is to support clinical diagnosis. The goal is to create an algorithm that, by integrating many
processes, ensures the existence of a tumour, offering a reliable technique for tumour
identification in MR brain pictures. Filtering, erosion, dilation, threshold, and tumour outlining
techniques such edge detection are the techniques used.
This study focuses on the extraction of tumours from MR brain images and their simplified
depiction so that everyone can comprehend it. The aim of this work is to present certain
important information to users in an easier-to-understand style, particularly for the medical
personnel who are attending to the patient. Developing an algorithm to extract the tumour picture
from the MR brain imaging is the goal of this effort. The final picture will be able to offer details
on the tumor's location, size, and dimensions. Its border will also provide us information about
the tumour that will be helpful in a variety of situations, giving the staff a stronger foundation
on which to determine the best course of action for curing the tumour. Finally, we detect whether
the given MR brain image has tumor or not using Convolution Neural Network.

1.4 SCOPE
Our goal is to create an automated system that can improve, classify, and segment brain tumours.
Healthcare professionals, including neurosurgeons, can use the system. It is anticipated that the
system, which combines computer vision, pattern analysis, and image processing techniques,
would increase brain tumour screening's effectiveness, efficiency, and sensitivity. Medical
imaging projects' main objective is to minimise mistake while extracting relevant and reliable
information from these pictures. The creation of supplemental tools that can aid in early
diagnosis or tumour identification and location monitoring is made possible by the appropriate
combination and parameterization of the stages.
