The human brain serves as the main controller of the humanoid system. Brain cancer arises when
brain tumours continue to grow, and brain tumours are caused by abnormal brain cell growth and
division. In the subject of human health, computer vision is crucial since it reduces the need for
human judgement to provide accurate results. CT, X-ray, and MRI scans are the most reliable and
secure common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures. MRI detects even the tiniest
objects. Our study focuses on the use of many approaches for brain MRI-based brain cancer
diagnosis. In order to remove any present noise, we preprocessed the data in this study using the
bilateral filter (BF). Convolution Neural Network (CNN) segmentation and binary thresholding are
necessary for precisely determining the tumor's location. There is use of datasets for training,
validation, and testing. Using our tools, we will assess whether or not the patient has a brain
tumour. The final findings will be assessed using a variety of performance metrics, including
sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The objective outcome of the recommended effort is to
outperform its counterparts.
